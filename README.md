# twitter_scraping

The purpose of this porject is to get data from Twitter for a sentiment analysis practice.

I edit the code from a video made by a dedicated YouTuber called Izzy Analytics, and this is the link of the video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KaffTIZ5II&ab_channel=IzzyAnalytics.

I modified part of the code to make it work on my computer since the video was using Edge and Windows system, whereas I am using Chrome and OS. 

The most challeging part of this project is to look at the inspect of the webpage which I have not learn any of them.
